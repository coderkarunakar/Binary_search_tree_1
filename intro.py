#Binary_search_Tree introduction 
#in order to find a node ex:5 we will traverse all the elements in the tree step by step which is linear search 
#in linear search in order to find some element we will be traversing all the elements which makes 
# O(n) work
#in binary search first we will sort it then we will find its mid point and then we will decide to travel left or right based on search value
#similarly we will sort the tree in this binary search tree as well
#i.e every thing smaller is on left and every thing larger is on right
#and root is  in the middle
#and this condition is not only for the root it also for the each and every node as well 

#please take a look in class notes as well
